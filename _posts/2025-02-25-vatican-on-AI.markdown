On January 28, 2025, the Vatican released "Antiqua et Nova" ("Ancient and New"), a comprehensive document examining the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human intelligence. Jointly issued by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, this document delves into the ethical, anthropological, and societal implications of AI's rapid advancement.

## Understanding "Antiqua et Nova"

"Antiqua et Nova" underscores the Christian belief that human intelligence is a divine gift, integral to our creation in God's image. The document emphasizes that while AI is a product of human ingenuity, it lacks the spiritual, moral, and creative dimensions inherent in human cognition. This distinction is crucial in discussions about AI's role and limitations in society.

The Vatican acknowledges AI's potential to revolutionize sectors such as education, healthcare, and environmental management. However, it also raises concerns about AI's capacity to disrupt labor markets, erode personal relationships, and infringe upon privacy through advanced surveillance technologies. The document highlights the ethical dilemmas posed by AI in warfare, particularly the development of autonomous weapons systems capable of lethal action without human intervention.

## Ethical Framework and Guidelines

Central to "Antiqua et Nova" is a call for an ethical framework guiding AI development and deployment. The Vatican advocates for AI that respects human dignity, promotes the common good, and operates under human oversight. The document warns against a technocratic paradigm where technology is viewed as the ultimate solution to all problems, potentially undermining human values and relationships.

The Vatican emphasizes the importance of transparency in AI systems, urging developers to ensure that AI applications are explainable and accountable. This transparency is vital to maintain public trust and to prevent the manipulation of information, which can lead to societal destabilization.

#### Recommended Framework for Development and Use of AI:
- **Ethical Responsibility**: AI development should always consider human dignity, ensuring it is used to enhance human life and the common good.
- **Human Oversight**: Although AI can perform many tasks, human guidance is essential to ensure its proper use, especially in decision-making.
- **Promotion of Integral Human Development**: AI should be used to support human flourishing, avoiding its exploitation for harmful purposes or in ways that erode human autonomy.

#### Key Takeaways for Engineers and Developers:
- **Distinction Between Human and AI Intelligence**: Understanding that AI's “intelligence” is task-specific and lacks true human-like thinking, empathy, and creativity.
- **Ethical Frameworks**: Developers should ensure AI systems are designed with moral responsibility, including accountability for its decisions.
- **Impact Assessment**: Engineers should evaluate how AI can affect both individuals and society, considering risks to human dignity and freedoms.
- **Continuous Reflection**: As technology evolves, ongoing discussions and updates on the ethical implications of AI must be prioritized to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.
